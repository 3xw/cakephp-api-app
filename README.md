# CakePHP Application Skeleton

## Installation
```bash
composer create-project --prefer-dist 3xw/cakephp-api-app myapp
```

You can now either use your machine's webserver to view the default home page, or start
up the built-in webserver with:

```bash
bin/cake server -p 8765
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8765` to see the welcome page.
